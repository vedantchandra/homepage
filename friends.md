One of the reasons I love astronomy is that it's very much a social science. 
I've been privileged to work with a fantastic group of collaborators and mentors who I'm always learning from, and who make this job fun. 
I've compiled a list of some of my close collaborators below, with a brief note about what we've worked on together. 
My goal is to make this list grow both vertically and horizontally!
